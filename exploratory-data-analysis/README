This was the first project of the exploratory data analysis course on Coursera.

At the time of completeing this project I had not yet learned all that much about R programming and had only minutes before the assignment deadline due to starting the class very late. Please excuse the sloppy/hacky coding practices for that reason.

The purpose of this project was to reproduce a set of plots give on a specific date for the included data set.
